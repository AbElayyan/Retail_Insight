# Retail Insights 

This Project aims to provide insights into the external factors influencing sales revenue across various chain store branches, along with recommendations for revenue enhancement. The data, collected from cash registers across different departments, highlights several influential factors, including holiday seasons, promotions, customer membership, age groups, and employee tenure.

Notably, giveaways generated the highest sales, while promotions had the lowest, with departments like gifts, activewear, and sales experiencing increased sales during holidays. Customer membership and age groups, especially the 39-59 age bracket, significantly impacted sales, with members spending more due to access to promotions and discounts.

Employee tenure also influenced revenue, particularly those with fixed-term contracts and over 25 months of employment. However, limitations exist, such as the limited timeframe of data collection and the absence of variables like stock count and customer satisfaction surveys, which could offer deeper insights into sales drivers.

Recommendations include collecting older data, incorporating stock count information, and conducting customer satisfaction surveys to understand sales dynamics better and improve decision-making processes.
